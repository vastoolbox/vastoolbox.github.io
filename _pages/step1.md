## Problem Statement:

Downloading Voice Assistant System (VAS)(e.g., Amazon Alexa) command history is useful for both personal and research purpose. For personal use, VAS users may need to record their memory with VAS or use VAS for showing their previous logs or for a person they care about. For research use, researchers may need to download commands as data to study the interaction between the participants and VAS. Existing VAS command downloading tools use Command Line Interface (CLI) only. Such CLI could only accessible by professional users, hard to be used by the people without technical background. In practice, professional users (e.g., computer science students) are usually required a few hours training before they can use the CLI. In addition, a few rounds proof reading and error correction are also required to ensure the accurate data downloading. Such usability issue may be addressed by a dedicated Graphical User Interface (GUI). In this project, we design a GUI for VAS data downloader. Such GUI not only reduces the learning and operating efforts for professional users, but also makes the VAS data downloader accessible for non-technical users.

## User Goal: 

- Personal users can download and save their previous interactions with the VAS.
- Researchers can, in addition to downloading and saving data, can also label data.

## User Action: 

- Users can download data for a single account of a specified time range.
- Users can download data for multiple accounts of a specified time range.
- Users can view the downloaded data.
- Users can also label the downloaded data and convert it into a specific format.


## User Potential Obstacles:

- Users may have difficulty to manage multiple accounts as well as specify multiple time ranges. 
- Users can get confused by multiple type of commands (e.g., VAS commands, usersâ€™ commands and arrow commands)and multiple type of labels.
