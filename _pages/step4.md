## Brief the user

The goal of this application is to download, visualize and label the voice assistant commands from Amazon Alexa.

To download, you will provide us your account information, like account and password, your section information like the time range you want to download.
After downloading, the commands will be saved to a .txt file and a list of audio files.

To visualize, you can specify the location of the files and then see and play the commands.

To labeling, you can specify the location of the files and then check the commands one by one. 
You can label the commands by clicking the checkbox of categories (e.g., this is a useless command).
