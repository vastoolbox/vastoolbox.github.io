## Final version

### Storyboard

- [Storyboard](/files/step3/Storyboard.pdf)

Explanation: The chosen design is according to the personas which are described previously in detail. The storyboard
is described accordingly with each persona. For example, in the final design for our
storyboard, we went ahead and included pictorial descriptions along with textual descriptions depicting what each
screen is representing in each step and in contrast to that, 
we do not have pictorial descriptions of the screens and every description of that step is described in the text beside it.
Also, we have used each persona from our previous
project steps, i.e., we have briefly described who Zafar is in our project step 2 but Deniz
is not mentioned.

### Interfaces

- [Downloading](/files/step3/Downloading.pdf)
- [Visualization](/files/step3/Visualization.pdf)
- [Labeling](/files/step3/Labeling.pdf)

Explanation: For the interface design, we went ahead and chose the one that is most
detailed and is the most user-friendly version. The design also describes all the possible tasks that the user can
perform while using this application. For example, each step in the storyboard is sequentially integrated accordingly
with the task analysis mentioned in project step 2. On the other hand, few designs present in the other versions 
are not sequentially appropriate and that is the main reason for why we chose this as the final version
over the others. Moreover, some designs like the downloading screen for view2 can be visually frustrating to the user as
that interface design clutters up the screen.
